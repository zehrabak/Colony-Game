# **Colony Game**
This project develops a strategy game simulation between colonies. Written in Java, adhering to object-oriented programming principles, the project involves colonies producing resources to increase their populations and food supplies. Additionally, tactical battles occur between colonies. Each colony employs different production and tactical strategies to grow its population and defeat rival colonies. The project emphasizes abstract classes, interfaces, and inheritance, ensuring that each class has a specific responsibility. This structure is implemented with a modular programming approach.
